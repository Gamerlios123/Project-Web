<b>
Question:<br>
Can I modify the <tt>Ocean.h</tt> file and add more members?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
No. Everything you need for this assignment is already there. Of course, there are many ways that
you could implement this assignment, but I want everyone to work with the same structures. The only
file that you are to modify is <tt>Ocean.cpp</tt> that I gave you. There's a comment in that file
that shows you exactly where all of your code belongs. You should probably only need to write five
functions in the file (one for each of the functions listed in <tt>WarBoats.h</tt>).

Question:<br>
What do we do if the client asks us to create an ocean with five boats, and then calls <i>PlaceBoat</i>
more than five times?
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
You don't have to worry about things like that. At this stage of the program, there are many things that
the client can do that will cause bad things to happen. We will see later on how we can prevent many
of those behaviors. For now, don't try to account for everything that could go wrong. If the client
says there will be five boats, you can assume that's how many you'll get. Also, you will get the boat IDs 
from 1 to 5, which makes them easy to use as indexes into the Boats array. 

<p>
<b>Don't forget, though, that the arrays are zero-based, so you'll have use <tt>ID - 1</tt> as the index.</b>

Question:<br>
The function <i>CreateBoat</i> is supposed to return a pointer. Isn't that going to be unsafe? Returning
a pointer from a function means that the pointer is no longer defined.
</b>
<p>

<b>Answer:</b><br>
It's safe to return a pointer, as long as the pointer is pointing at something that will still exist when
the function returns. The handout says that an ocean will be created <i>dynamically</i> and a pointer to it
will be returned. This means that you will use <tt><b>new</b></tt> to dynamically allocate the memory
for the ocean. Your code will look something like this:

<blockquote><pre>
Ocean *CreateOcean(int num_boats, int x_quadrants, int y_quadrants)
{
    // Create an ocean dynamically
  Ocean *ocean = new Ocean;

    // Create the array for the boats dynamically (use [] with new for arrays)
  ocean->boats = new Boat[num_boats];

    // Create the 2D array for the grid
  ocean->grid = new int[x_quadrants * y_quadrants];

    /*
       Here, you must initialize all of the fields of the
       structs being used (Ocean, Stats, Boats, grid, etc.)

    */

    // Return a pointer to the ocean
  return ocean;
}
</pre></blockquote>

Don't forget that everything that you allocated with <tt><b>new</b></tt> must be de-allocated
with <tt><b>delete</b></tt>. This will be done in <i>DestroyOcean</i>. (Don't forget the difference
between <tt><b>delete</b></tt> and <tt><b>delete[]</b></tt>.)

<b>
Question:<br>
If the <b>Ocean</b> is supposed to represent a 2-dimensional array, why is <tt>Ocean.grid</tt> a pointer to the
first element of a single-dimensional array?
</b>
<p>
<b>Answer:</b><br>
Long story short: It's easier. (This is because it's a <i>dynamic</i> array, not a static one, so you
have no way of determining how many rows/columns there will be when you declare the <tt>Ocean.grid</tt>
variable. Treating a 2D array as a 1D array is trivial. You just have to do the math (read: pointer arithmetic) 
yourself. 
<p>
<b>Example:</b><br>
Compare a static 2D array called <tt>points</tt> with a dynamic 1D array. There are 3 rows and 4 columns. The address
of each cell is displayed to the left and the subscript for that cell is displayed to the right.
<p>

<table border=0 cellspacing=5>
<tr>
<td valign="top">
<blockquote><pre>
<b>double</b> points[3][4];


<p>
<br>
<img src="PointsArray-2.gif">
</pre></blockquote>
</td>
<td>
</td>
<td valign="top">
<blockquote><pre>
<b>double</b> *pd = <b>new</b> double[3 * 4];
<p>
<font size=0>&nbsp;</font>
<img src="PointsArrayDynamic-1.gif">
</pre></blockquote>
</td>
</tr></table>

Given a row and column:

<blockquote><pre>
<b>int</b> row = 1, column = 2;
<b>double</b> value;
</pre></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>The static 2D array can be accessed using two subscripts, but the dynamic "2D array" can 
only be indexed with a single subscript.
<blockquote><pre>
value = points[row][column]; <font color="#003399"><i>/* OK      */</i></font>
value = pd[row][column];     <font color="#003399"><i>/* ILLEGAL */</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

<li>We (the programmers) have to do all of the arithmetic to locate an element using two subscripts:
<blockquote><pre>
value = pd[row * 4 + column];
</pre></blockquote>

<li>The compiler is still doing some of the work for us:

<blockquote><pre>
value = *(address-of-pd + (row * 4 + column) * sizeof(double));
</pre></blockquote>

<li> The general form to access a cell in a 2D array (represented as a 1D array) where ROW is the row, COL is the column,	WIDTH is 
	the number of columns, and ARRAY is the name of the array is:
	
<blockquote><pre>
ARRAY[ ROW * WIDTH + COL ]
</pre></blockquote>
	
So, to access row 2, column 1 in the example above:

<blockquote><pre>
pd[ 2 * 4 + 1 ] = pd[ 9 ]
</pre></blockquote>

which coincides with the diagram that shows <tt>point[2][1]</tt> (address 172) is the same as <tt>pd[9]</tt> (address 172).
Sorry, but there's no magic here.
