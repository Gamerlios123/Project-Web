<h2 id="Learning C++: What Lies Before You" >Learning C++: What Lies Before You</h2>
  There are three separate programming categories:

  + The procedural language, represented by C
  + The object-oriented language, represented by C++
  + Generic Programming, supported by C++ templates

<h2 id="The Origins of C++: A Little History">The Origins of C++: A Little History</h2>
  In the 1970's, languages such as C and Pascal helped usher in an era of structured
  programming, a philosophy that brought some order and discipline to a field badly in
  need of these qualities.
  
  C was also able to produce compact, fast-running programs, along with the ability to
  address hardware matters, such as managing communication ports and disk drivers.
  Because of this C was the dominant programming language of the 1980's.
  
  1980 also created the idea of object-oriented programming, or OOP.

<h2 id="The C Language">The C Language</h2>
  In the early 1970's, Dennis Ritchie worked to develop the Unix operating system.
  Operating systems require a language the was capable of producing compact, and fast
  programs, that could control hardware efficiently.
  
  This need was satisfied by assembly language, however assembly is a low-level 
  language 
  that must be specific to a computer processor. This means that it could not be
  transfered to another computer with a different processor. Doing so would require an
  entire rewrite of the software using a different assembly language.
  
  Unix, however was intended to work on a variety of computer types. This required a
  high-level programming language. High-level languages is focused around problem 
  solving
  instead of being tied in with the hardware like low-level languages.
  
  Compilers translate a high-level language to the the internal assembly language of a
  particular computer. The same high-level program can be used on several different
  platforms by using a separate compiler for each.
  
  Ritchie decided to develop a new programming language for the Unix operating system.
  So building from older languages, he created the high-level language C.

<h2 id="C Programming Philosophy">C Programming Philosophy</h2>
  In general, computer languages deal with two concepts - data and algorithms.
  The data constitutes the information a program uses and processes.
  The algorithms are the methods the program uses.
  
  C is a procedural which means it focus uses on the algorithm side of programming.
  
  FORTRAN and BASIC are early examples of procedural languages.
  These early procedural languages ran into organizational problems as programs grew 
  larger.
  
  Programs often used branching statements which route execution to various sets of 
  instructions. However with larger programs, these programs had such tangled routing that
  they were a disaster from a maintainability stand point and impossible to modify once the
  program got big enough.
  
  In response to this problem, computer scientists developed a more disciplined style of
  programming called "Structured Programming." C includes features to facilitate this
  approach.
  
  Structured programming limits branching to a small set of well-behaved constructions. 
  C incorporates these as the for loop the while loop the do while loop and the if else
  statement.
  
  With C the idea is to break a large program into small, easily programmed modules.
  C encourages this by developing program units called functions to represent individual
  task modules.

<h2 id="The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming">The C++ Shift: Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
  Although Structured Programming improved the clarity, reliability, and ease of 
  maintenance, large scale programs still remained a challenge. Object-oriented
  programming brings a new approach to that challenge.
  
  Unlike procedural programming which emphasizes algorithms, OOP emphasizes the data.
  The idea is to design data forms that correspond to essential features of a problem.
  
  In C++, a class is a specification describing such a new data form, and an object is a
  particular data structure constructed according to that plan.
  
  For example, a class could describe the general properties of a corporation executive
  (name, title, salary), while an object would be a specific executive.
  
  The OOP approach to program design is to first design classes that accurately represent 
  those thins with which the program deals.
  
  The process of going from a lower level organization to a higher level organization is 
  called bottom-up programming.
  
  Object-oriented programming facilitates creating reusable code, and that can eventually 
  save a lot of work.

<h2 id="C++ and Generic Programming">C++ and Generic Programming</h2>
  Generic programming is yet another programming paradigm supported by C++. It is similar
  to OOP in that it also aims to make it easier to reuse code and provide a good 
  abstraction. However, while OOP emphasizes the data, generic programming emphasizes
  independence from a particular data type.
  
  Generic programs are type independent. C++ data comes in many forms such as integers,
  floats, doubles, strings, etc. If yo wanted to make an add function in OOP for integers, 
  doubles, and floats you would need 3 different functions. Generic programming allows
  you to make one function that will work for all three data types and more.
  C++ templates id the feature that allows this to work.

<h2 id="The Genesis of C++">The Genesis of C++</h2>
  Like C,C++ began its life at Bell Labs, where Bjarne Stroustrup developed the language 
  in the early 1980's
  
  Stroustrup based C++ on C because of C's brevity, its suitability to system programming,
  its widespread availability, and its close ties to the Unix operating system.
  
  Stroustrup added OOP features and generic programming support to C without 
  significantly 
  changing the C component. This means any valid C program is a valid C++ program.
  
  Fun Fact: C++ comes from the C increment operator, which adds one to the value of a
  variable. Therefore, the name C++ correctly suggests and augmented version of C.
  
  Only after Stroustrup achieved some success with C++ did he add templates, enabling
  generic programming support.

<h2 id="Portability and Standards">Portability and Standards</h2>
  Portability refers to a programs capability to run on a range of platforms without 
  modification.
  
  Hardware is the first challenge to portability. A program that is hardware
  specific is not likely to be portable. For example, one that takes direct control of an
  IBM PC video board, speaks gibberish as far as, say, a sun is concerned.
  
  You can localize the hardware dependent code to small modules, that way you only need 
  to make one module for each desired platform. 
  
  The second challenge to portability is language divergence.
  The same problem can show up with spoken language. A Yorkshireman's dexcription of the
  day's events may not be portable to Brooklyn, even though english is said to be spoken
  in both areas. Computer programs too can develop dialects.
  
  Computer scientists required a published standard on exactly how the language should 
  work so that their versions of C++ would be compatible with other C++ code.
  So, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created a comitee in 1990
  (ANSI X3J16) to develop a standard for C++. (ANSI had already developed a standard for C).
  
  The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) soon joined the process with
  its own commitee (ISO-WG-21), creating a joint ANSI/ISO effort to develop the standard
  for C++.
  
  Several years of work eventually led to the International Standard (ISO/IEC 14882:1998)
  , which was adopted in 1998 by the ISOm, the International Electrotechnical Commision 
  (IEC), and ANSI. This standard, often called C++98, not only refined the description of
  existing C++ features but also extended the language with exceptions, run time type
  identification (RTTI), templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL).
  
  The year 2003 brought the publication of the second edition of the C++ standard (ISO/IEC
  14882:2003); the new edition was only meant to tidy up the first edition, not to add
  any new language features. This edition is often called C++03, however, because C++03
  did not add any language features, often it is common to call C++98/C++03 just C++98.
  
  C++ continues to evolve,and the ISO committee approved a new standard August
  2011 titled ISO/IEC 14882:2011 and informally called it C++11. Like C++98, C++11
  adds many features to the language. In addition, it has the goals of removing
  inconsistencies and of making C++ easier to learn and use.
  
  The C Standard was last revised as C99, which was adopted by the ISO in 1999 and
  ANSI in 2000.This standard adds some features to C, such as a new integer type, that
  some C++ compilers support.

<h2 id="Language Growth">Language Growth</h2>
  The original de facto standard for C++ was a 65-page reference manual included in the
  328-page "The C++ Programming Language",by Stroustrup (Addison-Wesley, 1986).
  
  The next major publishes de facto standard was "The Annotated C++ Reference Manual",by
  Ellis and Stroustrup (Addison-Wesely, 1990). This was a 453-page work.
  
  The C++98 standard, with the addition of many features, reached nearly 800 pages, even
  with only minimal commentary.
  
  The C++11 standard is over 1,350 pages long, so it augments the old standard substantially.

<h2 id="The Mechanics of Creating a Program">The Mechanics of Creating a Program</h2>
  Suppose you've wriitten a C++ program. How do you get it running?
  
  The general step are:
  
  1. Use a text editor of some sort to write a program and save it in a file. This file
      constitutes the source code of your program.
  
  2. Compile the source code. This means running a program that translates the source
      code to internal language called, machine language, used by the host computer. The
      file containing the translated program is the object code for your program.
  
  3. Link the object code with additional code. For example, C++ programs normally use 
      libraries. A C++ library contains object code for a collection of computer routines,
      called functions, to do various tasks. The linker combines your object code with the
      object code of any library your using as well as a little startup code. The 
      resulting file is a runtime version of your program called the executable. 
  
  The g++ flag for compiling under C++11 is "-std=c++11".
  Example g++ -std=c++11 use_auto.cpp

<h2 id="Creating the Source Code File">Creating the Source Code File</h2>
  Some C++ implementations, such as Microsoft Visual C++, Embarcadero C++ Builder, Apple XCode,
  Open Watcom C++, Digital Mars C++, and Freescale Code Warrior, provide integrated development 
  enviornments(IDEs) that let you manage all steps of program development, including
  editing from one master program.
  
  Other implementation, such as GNU C++ on Unix and Linux, IBM XL C/C++ on AIX, and the 
  free versions of the Borland 5.5 (distributed by Embarcadero) and Digital Marc 
  compilers, just handle the compilation and linking stages and expect you to type 
  commands on the system command line.

  In such cases, you can use any available text editor to create and modify source code. On a Unix
  system, for example, you can use vi or ed or ex or emacs. On a Windows system runnin Command Prompt
  mode you can use edlin or edit or any of several available program editors. (Sublime!).

  In naming a source file, you must use the proper suffix to identify it as a C++ file.

<h2 id="Compilation and Linking">Compilation and Linking</h2>
  Originally, Stroustrup implemented C++ with a C++-to-C compiler program
  instead of developing a direct C++-to-object code compiler. This program
  called cfront (for C front end), translated C++ source code to C source 
  code, which could then be compiled by a standard C compiler. This made it
  alot easier on the predominately C community.

<h2 id="Unix Compiling and Linking">Unix Compiling and Linking</h2>
  Originally, the Unix cc command invoked cfront. However, cfront didn't keep
  pace with the evolution of C++, and its last release was in 1993. You use
  the CC command to compile your program. The name is in uppercase letters to
  distinguish it from the standard Unix C compiler cc. 

  For example, to compile the C++ source code file spiffy.c, you would type this 
  command at the unix prompt:

<pre class="Terminal" ><code>
  <span style="color:#66ff33;">user@machine:~$</span> CC spiffy.C
  <!---->
</code></pre>

  If, there are no errors, the compiler generates an object code file with a .o 
  extension. This produced the file spiffy.o
  
  Next, the compiler automatically passes the object code file to the system linker, 
  which produces the finished executable which it names a.out.
  
  To run the program, you just type the name of the exectuable file: 

<pre class="Terminal" ><code>
  <span style="color:#66ff33;">user@machine:~$</span> a.out
  <!---->
</code></pre>

  Note that if you compile a new program, the new a.out executable file replaces the
  previous a.out. But if you develop an executable program that you want to keep, you
  just use the Unix mv command to change the name of the executable file.
