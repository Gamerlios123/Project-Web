Pros:
<ul>
<li>Efficient to insert/remove anywhere in the list
</li><li>Easy to grow and shrink at runtime
</li><li>Only use as much memory as we need
</li></ul>

Cons:
<ul>
<li>Allocating and deallocating individual nodes
</li><li>No random access to elements, locating a random element is <i>O(N)</i> (even if sorted)
</li></ul>

Simple analysis:

<ul>
<li>It's easy to solve the first con simply by using some kind of object allocator
  and pre-allocating nodes.<br>
</li><li>The second con can also be "solved". (Not solved, per se, but minimized.)
</li><li>One way we've seen attempting to "solve" the second problem is with some kind of balanced tree. This
gives us worst case of <i>O(lg N)</i>, which is significantly better than <i>O(N)</i>. 
</li><li>Using trees comes at a cost in both runtime (re-balancing) and implementation (code complexity).
</li><li>We'd like our data structures to have the benefits of linked lists and trees, but with
less runtime and implementation costs.
</li><li>The result will be some kind of <i>super</i> linked list or <i>high-performance</i> linked list.
</li></ul>

<p class="SectionHeader">Skip Lists (High-Performance Linked Lists)</p>

The fundamental problem with linked lists is that during a search, we must look at
every node in the list that comes before the target node, even if the list is sorted. (No binary search methods are possible.)
<p>
Searching for <b>T</b> in the list below requires looking at 12 nodes before reaching the node with <b>T</b>. We 
would pass through <b>B, C, E, G, H, I, K, L, M, P, R, S</b> then we would reach <b>T</b>.

</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-1.gif">
</blockquote>

If we create some nodes with 2 pointers, we can have them point "further" into the list, say 2 nodes ahead. This
let's us traverse 2 nodes at a time, effectively cutting the number of node traversals in half. We would look 
at <b>C, G, I, L, P, S, V</b> then "back up" to <b>S</b>, and then traverse the "normal" pointer to reach <b>T</b>.
<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-2.gif">
</blockquote>

We can take this notion further and move ahead 4 nodes at a time instead. Now we'd look at <b>G, L, S, Y</b>, then
backup to <b>S</b> to reach <b>T</b>.

<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-3.gif">
</blockquote>

or 8 nodes at a time, looking at <b>L</b> and <b>Y</b>, backing up to <b>L</b>, and then traversing
through <b>M, P, R, S</b> to reach <b>T</b>.

<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-4.gif">
</blockquote>
<br><br>
Finally, we could combine all of the "jump ahead" pointers:

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

Showing the <b>traversed</b> links as darker lines and the non-traversed but compared links as dotted lines:
<p>

</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-5a.gif">
</blockquote>

In the above list, the nodes we would have to look at are <b>L, Y, S, V, T</b>. (We'd actually look at <b>Y</b> twice.)
<p>
By having multiple <i>next</i> pointers, we can vary the speed at which we move through the list. Kind of 
a built-in <i>fast-forward</i> mechanism. Locating an item is a very simple:

</p><ol>
<li>Start out skipping through the list making the largest jumps.
</li><li>Continue until we land on a node with the an item that is greater than or equal to the item we're looking for.
</li><li>If we land on a node that contains the value we're looking for, we're done.
</li><li>If we "pass" the value, we backup one and traverse links on the next "lower" level.
</li><li>Goto step 2
</li></ol>


<!-- ************************************************************************************************ -->
<!-- ************************************************************************************************ -->
<p class="SectionHeader">Structure of a Skip List</p>

There are several key factors involved in building a skip list:
<ul>
<li>Should the list be single or double linked?
</li><li>How do we choose the size of our skip intervals? (Skip 2, 3, 4, 5, etc. nodes at-a-time?)
</li><li>How do we determine which nodes will be of what type? (How many pointers in a particular node?)
</li><li>How do we deal with different node sizes which implies different types? (A pointer can only point to one type of node)
</li></ul>

In this example, at the base level (level 0), we have a double-linked list where nodes contain a <i>next</i> and a <i>previous</i> pointer.
This is no different from a double-linked list we've been using. Some nodes have 0 or more <i>forward</i> pointers
which point (<i>skip</i>) into the list at larger intervals. (Using a dummy tail node can simply the
algorithm.)

<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-6aa.gif">
</blockquote>

In the diagram above, at level 0 we have the next (and previous) pointer. At level 1, we have forward pointers
that jump two nodes at a time. Level 2 forward pointers jump 4 nodes at a time and the forward pointers at level
3 jump 8 nodes at a time.

<p>
Given the scheme above:
</p><ul>
<li>Each level skips twice as many nodes as the previous level. 
</li><li>Level 0 moves 1 node at a time, level 1 moves 2 nodes, level 2 moves 4, level 3 moves 8, etc. 
</li><li>We can observe that at a given level, <i>n</i>, we can move <i>2<sup>n</sup></i> nodes at a time. 
</li><li>It's not hard to see that the complexity of finding an item in the worst case is <i>O(log<sub>2</sub> N)</i>.
<!--(Much like binary trees.)-->
</li></ul>

Of course, computer memory is finite, so there is a practical limit to how many levels we can have in 
our nodes. At level 32, we'd be moving over 4 billion nodes at a time, so clearly we have a 
practical limit to how large the nodes can grow.
<p>
Pointers required (for a double-linked list):
</p><ul>
<li>A level 0 node needs to store 2 pointers. (next and previous)
</li><li>Level 1 nodes need to store 3 pointers. (next, previous, 1 forward)
</li><li>At level 2, we store 4 pointers. (next, previous, 2 forward)
</li><li>At level <i>n</i>, we need to store <i>n + 2</i> pointers. (next, previous, <i>n</i> forward) 
</li></ul>

<p>
This doesn't account for the data itself. Also, as we'll
see, we will want to store the level of the node (an integral value).
</p><p>

With this scheme above, there are <i>2N</i> links at level 0 (<i>N</i> if singly-linked), <i>N/2</i> links at level 1, <i>N/4</i> links 
at level 2, <i>N/8</i> links at level 3, and <i>N/2<sup>L</sup></i> links at level <i>L</i>, which gives us
(assuming single-linked at level 0)
</p><blockquote>
<i>N + N/2 + N/4 + . . . = 
N(1 + 1/2<sup>1</sup> + 1/2<sup>2</sup> + 1/2<sup>3</sup> . . .) = 2N</i> 
</blockquote>
<!--
<i>N + N/2 + N/4 + . . . = 
N(1 + 1/2<sup>1</sup> + 1/2<sup>2</sup> + 1/2<sup>3</sup> . . .) = N/(1 - 1/2) = N/(1/2) = 2N</i> 

N(1 + 1/2<sup>1</sup> + 1/2<sup>2</sup> + 1/2<sup>3</sup> . . .) = N/(1/2) = 2N</i> 

-->

In this example, we've been using a <i>skip factor</i> of 2, meaning that each successive level skips
over 2 times as many nodes as the previous level. We can set our skip factor to any number, such as 3 or 4. 
Using <i>t</i> as our skip factor, the equations become:

<blockquote>
<i>N/t<sup>0</sup> + N/t<sup>1</sup> + N/t<sup>2</sup> . . . = 
N(1 + 1/t<sup>1</sup> + 1/t<sup>2</sup> + 1/t<sup>3</sup> . . .) = (t / (t - 1))N</i>
</blockquote>
<!--
<i>N/t<sup>0</sup> + N/t<sup>1</sup> + N/t<sup>2</sup> . . . = 
N(1 + 1/t<sup>1</sup> + 1/t<sup>2</sup> + 1/t<sup>3</sup> . . .) = N/(1 - 1/t) = N/(1/t) = (t/t-1)N</i>
	
N(1 + 1/t<sup>1</sup> + 1/t<sup>2</sup> + 1/t<sup>3</sup> . . .) = N/(1 - 1/t) = (t/t-1)N</i>

-->
<p>
Based on the skip factor, the number of nodes required is:

</p><blockquote><pre>  <i>t</i>   Pointers
--------------------------
  2    2N    
  3    3N/2  
  4    4N/3  
  5    5N/4
  6    6N/5
</pre></blockquote>

With an arbitrary skip factor, we have this: (SF is the skip factor, N is the number of nodes, and L is the level)

<blockquote><pre> (SF - 1)N
-----------
   SF<sup>L+1</sup> 
</pre></blockquote>

which is the number of nodes at each level. Plugging values into 
<i>N</i>, <i>SF</i>, and <i>L</i> in the equation gives us these numbers:
<p>
With a list of 262,144 (256K) nodes, we'd expect to see this distribution of nodes at each level:

<p class="SectionHeader">Implementation Details</p>

For these examples, we'll assume that the data is simply a 4-byte void pointer (32-bit computer):
<p>

</p><blockquote><pre><b>const</b> <b>unsigned</b> MaxSkipLevels = 32; <font color="#003399"><i>// can skip 4 billion nodes!</i></font>

Memory-efficient code to allow variable-sized SLNode structures:
<p>

</p><pre class="sourcecode"><code>SkipList::SLNode* SkipList::allocate_node(<b>unsigned</b> level) <b>const</b><!-- <b>throw</b>(SLException)-->
{
    <font color="#003399"><i>// On 32-bit computer: sizeof(data) + sizeof(level) + sizeof(prev) = 12</i></font>
  <b>unsigned</b> size = <b>sizeof</b>(data) + <b>sizeof</b>(level) + <b>sizeof</b>(prev) + (level + 1) * <b>sizeof</b>(<b>void</b> *);
  SLNode *node = 0;
  <b>try</b>
  {
    node = <b>reinterpret_cast</b>&lt;SLNode *&gt;( <b>new</b> <b>char</b>[size] );
  }
  <b>catch</b> (<b>const</b> std::bad_alloc &amp;)
  {
    <b>throw</b> SLException(SLException::E_NO_MEMORY, <font color="#9933CC">"allocate_node: Out of memory"</font>);
  }
  <!--memset(node, 0, size);-->
    <font color="#003399"><i>// initialize fields</i></font>  
  node-&gt;level = level;
  node-&gt;prev = 0;
  <b>for</b> (<b>unsigned</b> <b>int</b> i = 0; i &lt;= level; i++)
    node-&gt;next[i] = 0;
  
  <b>return</b> node;
}
</code></pre>

Note that this code is very inefficient (memory-wise):
<blockquote><pre>node = <b>new</b> SLNode; <font color="#003399"><i>// allocates 140 bytes for all nodes in the list</i></font>
</pre></blockquote>

Since most (94%) of the nodes are less than level 4, this wastes far too much memory.

<!--
The number of pointers we need 

Also, there is no reason that we are confined to doubling our skip intervals at every level. We could choose to triple or
quadruple the number of nodes skipped at each successive interval.

<p class="SectionHeader">Inserting into a Skiplist</p>

Suppose we want to insert <b>U</b> into this list:

<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-6bb.gif">
</blockquote>

We can easily find where to insert <b>U</b>: between <b>T</b> and <b>V</b>. However, this leads us to other questions:

<ul>
<li>Ok, so what kind of node do we construct? 
</li><li>A level 0 node? Level 1? Level 5? 
</li><li>What happens to the structure when we delete a node? (It's going to happen at some point.) 
</li><li>Since we are inserting/deleting random data, how can we be sure we can build the proper list with the exact kinds of
nodes in exact places?
</li><li>The simple answer is that we can't. (Not without a lot of work.) 
</li><li>However, we don't have to be exact. We can approximate.
</li></ul>

<p>

Looking at the (perfect and unrealizable) list above, we can see the distribution of nodes. Given a list with <i>N</i>
nodes, at each level we'd expect to see <i>N / 2<sup>L + 1</sup></i>, where <i>L</i> is the level. So, given the 16 nodes
above, we'd expect:

</p><blockquote><pre>        Node
Level   Count     Frequency             Nodes
----------------------------------------------------
  0       8      0.5     (50%)     B E H K M R T X
  1       4      0.25    (25%)     C I P V
  2       2      0.125   (12.5%)   G S
  3       1      0.0625  (6.25%)   L Y
</pre></blockquote>

The exception is the node with the highest level, which will have an extra count.

A <i>perfect</i> list with 2<sup>14</sup> nodes (16,384), will have a distribution like this:
<p>

</p><blockquote><pre>Level   Nodes     Frequency	
--------------------------------
  0     8192    0.5
  1     4096    0.25
  2     2048    0.125
  3     1024    0.0625
  4      512    0.03125
  5      256    0.015625
  6      128    0.0078125
  7       64    0.00390625
  8       32    0.001953125
  9       16    0.0009765625
 10        8    0.00048828125
 11        4    0.000244140625
 12        2    0.0001220703125
 13        1    0.00006103515625
</pre></blockquote>

<!--Again, in practice, the largest node having one extra count.-->
<p>
Ok, so what kind of node <i>do</i> we create when we insert an item? 
</p><ul>
<li>Simple, we just roll the dice and see what kind of node (<i>level</i>) we get. (Well, sort of...)
</li><li>We need our "dice" to have the frequencies (<i>probabilities</i>) shown above. 
</li><li>So, in the example above, we'd want to create a level 0 node 50% of the time, a level 1 node 25% of the time, 
	a level 2 node 12.5% of the time, a level 3 node 6.25% of the time, etc.
</li></ul>

<p>
Code similar to this would be used during the insertion phase:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="sourcecode">  <code><font color="#003399"><i>// calculate the level for the new node</i></font>
<b>unsigned</b> Level = 0;
<b>double</b> d = drand();  <font color="#003399"><i>// roll the dice (returns number 0 &lt; x &lt; 1)</i></font>

  <font color="#003399"><i>// maxLevel_ is the largest node currently constructed</i></font>
  <font color="#003399"><i>// and is initilized to 0 in the constructor.</i></font>
<b>while</b> ( (Level &lt;= maxLevel_) &amp;&amp; (d &lt; (1.0 / skipFactor_)) )
{
  Level++;
  d = drand();  <font color="#003399"><i>// produces a number between 0 and 1</i></font>
}

  <font color="#003399"><i>// if we've gone beyond the maximum level, raise the max</i></font>
<b>if</b> (Level &gt; maxLevel_)
  maxLevel_++;
  
  <font color="#003399"><i>// allocate the new node</i></font>
SLNode *NewNode = allocate_node(Level);
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p class="technote">
The reason for the <tt>Level &lt;= maxLevel_</tt> above is to constrain the size of the largest node.
If we have a small number of items in the list, we don't want (or need) large nodes that can skip
over large numbers of items. However, as the number of items grows, the size of the largest node
(maxLevel_) will increase.

A couple of issues with inserting that's different from a "regular" linked list:
<ul>
<li>Need to choose a size (level) for the new node. (Random with given probability)
</li><li>Need to keep track of <i>all</i> of the nodes that led to the new one.
</li></ul>

Like insertion, we need to keep track of <i>all</i> of the nodes that led to the new one
so that we can update the pointers correctly. There is only slightly more work to be done due
to the fact that not all of the nodes that lead to the deleted node were traversed during the
find. In the example above, nodes <b>P</b> and <b>R</b> need to be updated, yet they didn't
lead to <b>S</b>.

Notes:
</p><ul>
<li>The head pointer will always be of the largest size with all of the pointers initialized to the tail.
</li><li>The tail pointer is just a level 0 node. <!-- (although some of the diagrams make it look like the head node.)-->
</li><li>Skip lists are another form of <i>randomized</i> algorithms. We add "randomness" to help the performance. (Much like hash tables)
</li><li>Compared to some balanced tree algorithms, the skip list is much simpler to implement.
</li><li>Like hash tables, we trade memory for speed. (More pointers/node <tt>==</tt> faster search) 
</li><li>Most of the implementation complexity is in keeping track of the forward pointers when inserting/deleting.
</li><li>Node based<!-- (like trees) -->, so we'd use some kind of object allocator. What's the "problem" with using an
object allocator for the nodes?
</li><li>What happens to our <i>locality of reference</i> that the object allocator provides?
</li><li>Some claim the complexity of implementing balanced trees (and their associated recursiveness)
  makes skip-lists a more practical data structure to implement.

<b>Inserting 'S'</b>
</p><p> 

</p><blockquote>

Locating the position to insert <b>S</b> into the list. The thick <b>black lines</b> represent pointers in nodes that <b>WILL</b> be affected
by the insertion of a new node. This is regardless of the size of the new node. (All nodes are at least at level 0.) The thick 
<font color="red"><b>red lines</b></font> represent pointers in nodes that <font color="red"><b>MAY</b></font> be affected by the insertion of a new node. 
This will depend entirely on the size of the new node which can be any size from 
0 to MaxLevel + 1.
<p> 
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-Insert-S1.gif">
</blockquote>

<tt>MaxLevel</tt> is currently set to 4. This is the level where the search for <b>S</b> will begin from 
the head node. Assume we have a method called <i>locate</i> that is used to find a node, or the position
in the list where a new node will go. The method must keep track of the affected nodes. In this case, the 
<i>SLNodeArray</i> will contain pointers to <tt><b>head, head, L, L, P, R</b></tt>. These pointers will 
reside at index 5 through 0, respectively. Assuming a function called <i>locate</i>, which locates the 
position for the new node and fills in an array called <i>BeforeNodes</i>, this is what the 
<i>BeforeNodes</i> array should look like:

<blockquote>
<p>
<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr><th>Before calling locate</th><th></th><th>After calling locate</th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-1.gif">
</blockquote>
</td>
<td width="60"></td>
<td align="center">
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-2.gif">
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</p></blockquote>
<p>


</p><p>
If the level of the new node happens to be 3 (randomly chosen based on the ideal distribution of nodes), then only 
4 of the 6 potential pointers will be affected. The thick <b>black lines</b> represent
existing pointers that need to be modified in response to the level 3 node that was inserted. 
The <font color="blue"><b>blue lines</b></font> represent the pointers in the new node that need to be setup.
</p><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-Insert-S2.gif">
</blockquote>

<p>
If, however, the level of the new node happens to be 5 (again, randomly chosen), then all 
6 of the potential pointers will be affected (and <tt>MaxLevel</tt> will be increased to 5):

<b>Deleting 'S'</b>
</p><p> 

</p><blockquote>
As with inserting, we need to first locate the position where <b>S</b> resides in the list. 
<p>
Assuming we added a level 3 node: 
The thick <b>black lines</b> represent pointers in nodes that <b>WILL</b> be affected by the deletion. Notice
that the number of pointers affected is different for the delete operation. Unlike with insertion, we
know exactly which pointers will be affected because we know the size (level) of the node being deleted.

</p><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-Delete-S1.gif">

<tt>MaxLevel</tt> is still set to 4 so we will begin the search from this level. Again, the <i>locate</i> method
will fill in the array of affected nodes. In this case, the <i>SLNodeArray</i> will only contain one non-head pointer. This pointer will always
be at the highest level pointing to the node. In this case, since node <b>S</b> is a level 3 node, then only the pointer at level 3 in the
<i>BeforeNodes</i> array will be changed. 
<p>
The search started at level 4 and looked ahead to <b>U</b>. Since <b>U</b> was larger than <b>S</b>, we had to step down
to level 3. At level 3 we looked ahead to <b>L</b>. <b>L</b> is less than <b>S</b>, so we moved to node <b>L</b>. When
we look ahead from <b>L</b>, we see <b>S</b>, which is the node we are looking for, so we set index 3 in the <i>BeforeNodes</i> to <b>L</b>.
</p><p>
This is what the <i>BeforeNodes</i> array should look like:

</p><blockquote>
<p>
<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr><th>Before calling locate</th><th></th><th>After calling locate</th></tr>
<tr valign="top">
<td align="center">
<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-1.gif">
</blockquote>
</td>
<td width="60"></td>
<td align="center">
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-3.gif">
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</p></blockquote>
<p>

This is where deletion differs from insertion. With insertion, our array of pointers included <i>every</i> node from the highest level down
to 0. With deletion, we may not have traversed through every level to find the node. In fact, we only find the affected node at the level of the 
deleted node. This means that after finding the node to delete, we have to go back and fill in the rest of the <i>BeforeNodes</i> so it looks like 
this:
</p><p>
  
</p><blockquote>
<p>
<table cellspacing="5" cellpadding="5">
<tbody><tr><th>After calling locate</th><th></th><th>After "fixing" the array</th></tr>
<tr>
<td align="center" valign="top">
<blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-3.gif">
</blockquote>
</td>
<td width="60"></td>
<td align="center" valign="top">
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-BeforeNodes-2.gif">
</td>
</tr></tbody></table>
</p></blockquote>
<p>

Before deleting the node, you need to "hook up" the affected nodes. If you delete the node before hooking up the pointers, you 
won't know where to point the pointers. The diagram shows how the pointers are modified before the deletion:

</p><p> 
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-Delete-S2.gif">
</blockquote>

Setting the pointers is as simple as copying the values from the deleted node, <b>S</b> in this case, to the affected nodes.
This is done by copying the level 3 pointer to node <b>L</b> (at level 3), copying the level 2 pointer to node <b>L</b>,
copying the level 1 pointer to node <b>P</b>, and copying the level 0 pointer to node <b>R</b>. The last step is to
copy the previous pointer from <b>S</b> to the previous pointer in <b>T</b>.
<p>

Finally, realize that, although I drew the pictures above showing the tail node as the maximum
level, it really only needs to be a level 0 node:
</p><blockquote>
<img src="./Skip Lists_files/SkipLists-6aa.gif">
</blockquote>

 The head node still requires all levels (not shown above) because it is pointing at other nodes. The tail 
 node points at nothing. It is merely being pointed at by the other nodes and is used as a sentinel, 
 marking the end. (Sometimes, using a separate tail-pointer can lead to simpler code.)
