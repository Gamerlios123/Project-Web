Assignments
</p>

<ul>
<li>Read this <a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/Courses/CS280/GammaSutra-MemManager.htm">article</a>
about memory managers from a game programmer's perspective. (Notice the <i>O(n)</i> notation being used. 
You don't have to completely understand it at this point.)
<p>
</p></li><li>Make sure that you refresh your knowledge of Doxygen for documenting your source code. An example 
	can be found on this page <a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/docs/doxygen/index.html">here</a>. 
<!--
	<b>Make sure you 
	remember how to create a CHM (Compiled Help File) file from your code.</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Download the necessary files to create CHM 
			from <a href="../../../../Files/htmlhelp.zip">here</a>. The archive contains two files:
			<tt>hhc.exe</tt> and <tt>itcc.dll</tt>. Just put those files your PATH somewhere.</li>
	</ul> 
-->

<p>
</p></li><li>Make sure that you review how to compile projects from the command line with these compilers:
<ul>
	<p>
</p><li>GNU C++ 4.8.3 (<a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html">C++11 support)</a> This is the version 
	installed on the computers here
	and it is also 64-bit. It implements all of C++11. 
	<p>
</p></li><li>Clang 3.4 (<a href="http://clang.llvm.org/cxx_status.html">C++11 support)</a> This is the version 
	installed on the computers here.
	It is 32-bit only for Windows. Linux and Mac OS X have both 32-bit and 64-bit. It implements all of C++11.
	The nice thing about Clang is that the command-line options are identical to GNU g++, so you can just
    change <tt><b>g++</b></tt> to <tt><b>clang++</b></tt> when compiling.
	<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Building a project with Clang under Windows may fail to <i>link</i> properly. The code 
	will compile (if you didn't have any
errors), but will fail to link properly. This means that no executable will be created, or if one is 
created, it may fail to execute. 
You don't have to worry about that at this time. I will only be checking to see that your code 
<i>compiles</i> cleanly with Clang. You can use <a href="http://blog.johannesmp.com/2015/09/01/installing-clang-on-windows-pt1">
this guide</a> to get it working on Windows, if you'd like.</p></li>


	<p>
<!--
<li>Microsoft C++ 12.0 (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh567368.aspx">C++11 support</a>) 
	This is the compiler that comes with VS 2013 and is installed here. 
	This is supposed to be the default compiler (64-bit) when you open a command window. If it isn't,  
	you must first type <tt><b>setvc12</b></tt> to enable the command line tools for this version. 
	If you want the 32-bit compiler, you need to type <tt><b>setvc12-32</b></tt>.
	You need to do 	this everytime that you open a command window. As long as you don't close the window, 
	the command line tools will be enabled.)
	It implements most (but not all) of C++11.
-->
	<!--
	<li>If you are having problems configuring your computer to use Microsoft's compiler from the command line
			look <a href="../../../../docs/CommandLineConfigs.html">at this page</a>.
			-->

</p></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>Download the <a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/">preinstalled programs</a> 
and put them on your computer. There is also a PDF there that explains what to do: 
<a href="http://azrael.digipen.edu/~mmead/www/public/Files/preinstalls/readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf">readme-2014-RTIS-image.pdf</a>.
You can ignore the stuff about Visual Studio, as it's not required for this class.
